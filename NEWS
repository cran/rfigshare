v0.3
----

Major improvements to authentication.  First-time authentication no longer includes the tedious process
of getting and storing keys and tokens. This is all handled automatically thanks to improvements in
httr 0.3.  The use of explicitly passing tokens is still supported and used fo the internal/automated
testing of the package.  

* More explicit error handling ([#75](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/75))
* Handle the `mine` argument for `fs_details` automatically ([#76](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/76))
* Fixes fs_search ([#64](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/64)) and thus fs_ids, [#66](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/66).
* Fixes fs_browse (though API still limits to 10 results, [#77](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/77)).
* Fixes fs_create_authors ([#78](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/78)).
