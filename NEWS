Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
* Following the RStudio convention, a .99 is appended after the patch
  number to indicate the development version on Github.  Any version
  Coming from Github will now use the .99 extension, which will never
  appear in a version number for the package on CRAN.

v0.3.7.100
----------

- `fs_tag_as_rfigshare()` accepts and passes `session` object to support
  unattended uploads [#105](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/pull/105).

v0.3.7
------

Compatibility with httr 1.0 release

v0.3.6
----------

Minor bugfix

* Make sure README.md (and HTML vignette) pass the W3C validator (at least when the markdown is rendered by pandoc)

v0.3.5
-----------

Minor bugfix

* Skip uuid test if uuid is not available (e.g. on Solaris machines, thanks CRAN maintainers). 

v0.3.4
-----------

Minor bugfix

* Skip online tests if authentication fails 


v0.3.3
-----------

Minor bugfix

* tests use status codes instead of text parsing to determine API response errors. Makes tests more robust and compatible with latest `httr`, see [#84](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/84) 

v0.3.2
------

Minor bugfix

* include `httpuv` in imports (see [#82](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/82) and  [httr/110](https://github.com/hadley/httr/issues/110))

v0.3.1
------

Minor bugfix

* API now returns author ids as integers instead of character strings, breaking test. Test now fixed. 


v0.3
----

Major improvements to authentication.  First-time authentication no longer includes the tedious process
of getting and storing keys and tokens. This is all handled automatically thanks to improvements in
httr 0.3.  The use of explicitly passing tokens is still supported and used fo the internal/automated
testing of the package.  

* More explicit error handling ([#75](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/75))
* Handle the `mine` argument for `fs_details` automatically ([#76](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/76))
* Fixes fs_search ([#64](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/64)) and thus fs_ids, [#66](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/66).
* Fixes fs_browse (though API still limits to 10 results, [#77](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/77)).
* Fixes fs_create_authors ([#78](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/78)).

v0.2-9
-----
* Greatly streamlined authentication to avoid having to provide tokens. ([#72](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/72))
* Updated unit tests, and now run as part of check [#67](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/pull/67)
* Consistent with latest changes to httr ([#70](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/70))
* Includes travis continuous testing integration ([#69](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/69))
* Displays a yaml-based summary from `fs_details`


v0.2-8
-----
* Minor bugfix: avoids the `text_content` warning ([#59](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/pull/59))
* Improved documentation and added ggplot2 to Imports list



v0.2-7
-----
* Bugfix following changes to API in `fs_update`
